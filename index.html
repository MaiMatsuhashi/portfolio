			<div id = "abouttext" >Originally born in Japan, I grew up in Eagan, 
			Minnesota and moved to Boston, Massachusetts
			to attend Northeastern University. Here, I am a 
			second year student studying the combined major
			of Mechanical Engineering and Design and plan to
			graduate in 2024. I have always been intrigued by 
			STEM as well as creative fields and have found my
			studies to be the ideal combination, integrating
			human-centered design with engineering and 
			product development.<br> <br>
		

			I am currently looking for my first co-op position
			for the fall of 2021 and am eager for a challenge 
			that will help me continue to build a foundation of 
			innovative and advanced design engineering. <br> <br>

			Outside of my studies, I enjoy yoga, dance,
			videography, and facetiming friends and family 
			back home. My favorite book is The Time 
			Travelerâ€™s Wife (favorite series is Harry Potter), 
			and my favorite movie is Mamma Mia 2: Here We Go 
			Again (favorite series is Star Wars).</div>
