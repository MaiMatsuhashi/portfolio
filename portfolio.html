			  <p>My first-year engineering course revolved around game design. First semester we designed and built an Escape Room in a box. Pictured is the Arduino board used to “override self-destruct” to win the game (right) and laser-cut decoder wheel with its designs in AutoCAD (left).&nbsp;</p></div>

			  <p><b><i>Escape Room: Old Tech</i></b></p>
			  <p>Second semester, our whole class collaborated to build a live, working Escape Room for students to play at the end of the spring. Before parting due to the pandemic, my team was working to build an “old tech” TV using an Arduino board, a fan motor, a black disk, and a single light based on the original Nipkow disk. After moving a bottle with buttons to “catch the poison”, the TV would display a number. See the unfinished TV and the start of its housing to the left and it displaying the number “8” on the right.&nbsp;</p></div>

			  <p><b><i>SolidWorks Chessboard Design</i></b></p>
			  <p>I designed a chessboard with unique pieces based on my favorite movie, Mamma Mia. From bottom left to right the pieces are based on the song “Angel Eyes” from the second movie, the sailboat owned by one of the characters, the hotel on the island, and a ring for the wedding in the first movie.&nbsp;</p></div>

			  <p><b><i>Experience Design 1: Final Project</i></b></p>
			  <p>I identified an opportunity, researched the experience, mapped and articulated insights, and designed and evaluated solution concepts for the question: <i>How might we reduce high-contact touchpoints?</i> The final solution concept was a hands-free door using sensors where doorknobs would normally be.
